# **Beauty Store Q1 Sales Dashboard**

## **Overview**

This project is a sales analysis dashboard for a beauty store, focusing on performance across the first quarter (Q1) of the year. The objective was to understand sales trends, identify high-performing products and regions, and provide actionable insights for business improvement.

## **Tools Used**

\- Microsoft Excel: Used for initial data scanning and cleaning. Since the dataset was relatively small, Python was not necessary.

\- Power BI: Used to build a dynamic and interactive dashboard with visual breakdowns of sales, profit, quantity sold, mode of payment, and regional performance.

## **Objectives**

\- Analyze total sales performance from January to April.

\- Understand product performance by quantity, total sales, and profit.

\- Compare performance across different branches (regions).

\- Evaluate the impact of mode of payment on sales experience.

\- Identify issues or gaps in performance, especially after January.

## **Key Insights**

\- Sales peaked in January and declined significantly by April (−68%).

\- Total sales for Q1: ₦1.38 million

\- Top product by sales and profit: Lip Gloss

\- Highest sales by region: Port Harcourt

\- Foundation had the highest average sale value despite not having the highest quantity sold.

\- Mascara was the only product that saw a performance spike in April.
